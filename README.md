# Finviz-Webscraper-Tutorial
Given a finviz filter url, we can scrape a list of stock tickers from it.

This python program depends on the Selenium and Webdriver Manager libraries to run. 
Those can be installed with "pip install selenium" and "pip install webdriver_manager". If you get any 
error messages with the pip command that could be due to your python version. Try "pip3" instead.

First start by creating some screener in finviz. Here I selected any company in the technology sector that pays out a 3% of higher dividend.
Since finviz screeners parameters are saved into the url, the subsequent tutorial and code will work for any finviz screener.
